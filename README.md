Groupware for recording parts and assemblies by serial number and version along with associated test data and comments

PartForge is a kind of database that grew out of a need to keep track of assembly details and test data of manufactured products.
Basically, it keeps track of anything that has a serial number, 
including anything with a serial number that is composed of other things with serial numbers.  
An assembly like a car is composed of many sub assemblies, each of which has it's own unique identity, 
test results, properties 
(revision, configuration, setting, firmware versions, etc.), photos, comments, and story (who, when, what).
